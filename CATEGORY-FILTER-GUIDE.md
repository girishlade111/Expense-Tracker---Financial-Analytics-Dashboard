# Category Filtering - Quick Guide

## ✅ Feature is Ready!

The category card filtering is now fully functional. Here's how to use it:

### How It Works

1. **Click any category card** in the "Expense by Category" section
2. **Transaction History will show only that category's transactions**
3. **The clicked category card glows purple** to show it's active
4. **Section title updates** to show filter: "Transaction History (Category Name)"
5. **A "Show All" button appears** to clear the filter

### Visual Feedback

- **Hover**: Category cards lift up with shadow effect
- **Active**: Selected category has purple glow and stays elevated
- **Cursor**: Pointer cursor shows cards are clickable

### Toggle Off

- Click the same category card again to turn off the filter
- Or click the "Show All" button
- Or click a different category to switch filters

### Test It Now!

1. Click any category card (e.g., "Food", "Travel", "Utilities")
2. Watch the transaction table filter to show only that category
3. Click "Show All" to return to full view
